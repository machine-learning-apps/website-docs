From the [project page](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages):

`fastpages` uses [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) to simplify the process of creating [Jekyll blog posts](https://jekyllrb.com/) on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) from a variety of input formats.

### `fastpages` provides the following features:

- Create posts containing code, outputs of code (which can be interactive), formatted text, etc directly from [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/); Notebook posts support features such as:
    - Interactive visualizations made with [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/) remain interactive.
    - Hide or show cell input and output.
    - Collapsable code cells that are either open or closed by default.
    - Define the Title, Summary and other metadata via a special markdown cells
    - Ability to add links to [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) and GitHub automatically.
- Support for comments, supported natively through GitHub Issues.
- Built-in search.
- Support for customizing the styling of your site.
- Embed Twitter cards and YouTube videos.
- Categorization of blog posts by user-supplied tags for discoverability.
- Create and edit [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) posts.
- Create posts, including formatting and images, directly from Microsoft Word documents.
- Write posts on your local machine and [preview them with live reload](#running-the-blog-on-your-local-machine).
